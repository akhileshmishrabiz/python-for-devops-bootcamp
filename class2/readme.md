401 Unauthorized = "Who are you?"

You need to authenticate (log in)
You haven't provided credentials or they're invalid
Example: Accessing an API without an auth token

403 Forbidden = "I know who you are, but you can't do that"

You're authenticated but lack permission
The server knows who you are but refuses your request
Example: A regular user trying to access admin-only resources
